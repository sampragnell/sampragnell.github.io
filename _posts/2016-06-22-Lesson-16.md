At the beginning of the lesson we discussed about our plan we did for a game last week for homework,he told us that it needed to look smart and finished so i learnt in the future everything has to look professional so people will pick you in a job as it is part of human nature.

Secondly we were told to go onto google drive and organise our work into folders as most of ours was randomly spread out and mixed around. Ive learnt organisation is key as it will help you in life be more punctual generally better as a person , i organised my work into folders of science , blog posts,Microbit tutorials and IT other. 

Finally Kishen and i started making our game Bop it Smash which we have done for homework we have nearly finished. This made me feel good as we are so organised so overall the lesson taught me about Organisation (its key)
