Lesson 7 Prezi 

`At the start of the lesson as usual we checked if the homework from the previous week had been done three people hadn't added a link so they had to stay behind a t lunch.

Then we had a look at at website called prezi. Before we had a look at the site we discussed the meaning of the word presentation . after that we talked about what we think a good presentation is we decided we shouldn't look and read what it says on your slides as this is just a tool to help.

Next our teacher showed us 2 of his presentation which were a great example as they were perfect using some superb techniques to link his information. Eventually we went on to the site and made an account and logged on we messed around and used different techniques we'd found on the site which led on to our homework to play around with the features of Prezi.
