**Lesson 11- Microbit**

At the start of the lesson like normal we looked through google classroom to see any questions people had asked. Our teacher described how we have to explain the problem better if we want to ask it on google classroom otherwise he won't answer it.

Then our teacher put up our lesson task on google classroom which was to finish all the tutorials on javascript on microbit. However we are carrying it on next week as it is quite a long task and for each tutorial he has put a link on google classroom for an extension to each one. In the lesson I completed the tutorial and extension for the first one and the tutorial for the first one. Every time we complete one we have to copy and paste it on google docs to show evidence of our work.

In this lesson we learnt a lot more about coding on javascript and where different codings are. At the end of the lesson he gave us homework to do our normal, weekly blog post (this) and do 20-30 minutes of carrying on with trying to complete the tutorials.
