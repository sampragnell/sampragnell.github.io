    <td>Today I was working on the functions section. It was good as i learnt imports and how to define things. When I am stuck i plug away at the work. Then, I ask the person next to me for help who are both good coders. After that, I google the answer when I get it I also try to understand what I did wrong.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As the exercise was introducing something new it was challenging to learn. I need to practise being able to pick up new code quickly and easily. That was the only thing that limited my learning so the lesson was good. I need to work on never giving up as that is important.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Because I have been given a new technique by my friends I can now work well without that much struggle. At all occasions I will now use these tactic so i can get round any problem. This will improve my learning as well.</td>
