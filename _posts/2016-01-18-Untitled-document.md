Lesson 1 review

First in the lesson we talked about media and the different types such as social media. I learnt how media is not all online and how media is communicating. ive learnt as time goes on media has developed from letters to facebook and twitter. Next we did media literacy bingo and we had to tick off types of media literacy by going round the class asking whether or not people could eg: remember their phone number if they had twitter. I learnt how sell a different entity to you, and try and sound all amazing. However it was surprising how i thought i knew what media was but it was a much bigger category than i thought.

Finally in the lesson we analyzed the Kia Soul 2014 commercial with hamsters the commercial conveyed how the car has got better since the old one this was shown by the hamsters being fat at the start being barely able to jog from being fit and walking out on the red carpet after being driven in the Kia soul. Our Teacher told us about text and how a point it put across by the advertiser.

Then we learnt about sub-text and how it's a hidden point they are trying to show eg: when the hamster fell down fell down he got back up again just like when like the kia company were building the car. 

overall i have never really looked at an advert like that and will always look advert differently.
