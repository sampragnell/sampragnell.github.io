  <tr>
    <td>My strategies I used were work quickly but carefully not missing anything out in the book and taking every detail into account like capital letters and semi colons as they are the most important as it is the difference between working code and corrupt code ,  if it doesn't work the I need to check whether I have studied the book and taken attention to detail.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work more efficiently than I already do this will not limit my learning as I will work quicker and be able to help my peers or give advice and help them. If I'm ahead I will be more motivated as I'll feel good about the way I'm working and will want to work even better and look into techniques for that . Also seeing other screens while running the code will help as that could suggest what I need to do to get to the answer without being told the answer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To work better next time I will work harder and faster as this will not hinder my learning and will only improve it . I will also set up my raspberry pie quicker at this will enable me to get my coding started quicker if I start earlier then I will be more productive and be able to set higher ambitious goals to make me work better in all subject as I will try and work quicker in them too 
When I setup quicker I will try and beat that time and eventually do it really really fast.</td>
