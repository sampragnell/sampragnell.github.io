    <td>the book was a big help to me this lesson as reading in detail helped me understand the breadboard and what I had to do to , to make a full circuit trial and error was also important as when adding the code in certain areas helped me understand what had to go where.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>At first I was limited by not knowing about resistors and I was using the wrong resistor and putting them in the wrong areas however another student kindly pointed out what I was doing wrong and this helped me progress through the tasks and assessments rapidly but carefully.</td>

    <td>Next time I will know about the resistors and how they work and their reasoning to help me code with more advanced circuits this will let me be able to progress onto harder tasks yet this will challenge me and this will enable me to become better at coding .</td>
