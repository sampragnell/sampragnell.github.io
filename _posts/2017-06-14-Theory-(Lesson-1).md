This lesson was a theory lesson it was all about thought process and how humans do not think like computers and have an auto switch.

We started off by writing the stages that we would use to make a cup of tea m our stages were things like fetch kettle.

However when we thought about how a computer would think it through and it would be much more orderly and sophisticated as if you wanted to make a robot arm produce a cup of tea a lot of thought would have to be put into it because if you think about it fetching kettle requires a lot more as it only has one arm it needs to be able to lift the lid , turn on the kettle and know exactly where the milk , how to acces water by turning handle but then not holding the kettle and if you look like that into our lives we will learn so much more.
