Lesson 10  

At the start of the lesson Mr. Keen told us about the BBC Microbit which ours hadn't been delivered itâ€™s a coding device that can be coded and gets coded by using lights.

We  watched a video about the Microbit and  Children imagining what they could do with it Mr. Keen told us we were just aliens programmed not smart thinking which hurt me.

Next we went on tutorials on The Microbit after Mr keen told us to play around on it ( another robotic instruction ) I went on Youtube and found a tutorial to make a coin game which was successful i really enjoyed using the Microbits and i can't wait to get them.
