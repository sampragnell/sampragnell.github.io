  <tr>
    <td>thinking logically , and teamwork were most effective as when working with a partner you need to co-operate well as if you have one reading and one typing together you can understand the code and work out what you have to do if you can't get round the problem both of you can work it out together on how the computer is reacting to the code we have put in.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to get in the habit of starting g strong and getting into a rhythm as once I'm in a rhythm I feed I'm more productive as I work through efficiently adding details or changing what the book says and coding it corectly , I also need to get in a habit of frequently saving my work beacause I lost a few pages from being careless it really is something I need to work on If i want to get places.

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will give clear and detailed instructions to my partner so I can save time , code smarter so my partner can get into the habit of using and knowing when to use capital letters and when to use lower case and semi colons as once we know when to use them correctly when we code without a book it becomes easier as we know when to do what to enhance our learning to its full potential.</td>
