    <td>Using friends this lesson was quite effective as my friend next to me is on the same part of the course if we get stuck we can help each other to progress further using eqch others ideas to solve the problem I think this is very effective as it is efficient yet you understand more and more each time you solve anew problem which is the reason why I accomplished 2 badges this lesson </td>

    <td> I can get slightly distracted but not majority so I don't think it limits my learning but in my my opinion it is bound to happen so I think it makes coding more fun as it can get a little tedious , I need to many help some others who are struggling as I think it would be horrible to be in tht position.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could next time do a bit of work at home as that can speed up the course and in doing that will become familiar in my mind and this will allow me to be fresh each lesson knowing I've done a decent amount of work at home which means the classwork will be easier to reach and extend upon</td>
