    <td>Knowing what the code was asking me to do was effective as then you could understand the wiring that was needed like when you need Light sensitive resistor you knew where to put it because of the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>This week I worked slowly as I was trying to advance my work further and challenge myself further however i was limited by broken light sensitive resistors and some were missing therefore I could not complete that task which was a shame as that code looked like it could of been cool.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve by trying the best I can at finding a light sensitive resistor I will also concentrate on making my code inch perfect as this will secure that if there are problems in my work it will not be my code it is most likely to be my wires and I need to make sure that my wires will be perfect but I will not be able to do that as I am on to robot arms soon.</td>
