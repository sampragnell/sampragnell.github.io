First in the lesson we spoke with our peers and teacher about the advantages and disadvantages of social media into three catogaries okay,bad and good an example of good would be meeting new people for the okay sexting as this could be good for adults but for kids it is illlegal but bad is stalking or grooming even though your social media account may be private. in no way can the bad ones be  acceptable apart from police to work out a case.For the remainder of the lesson we had to arrange ourselves in groups of 5 and arrang scenarios from the most harmful and unharmmful and then go round the class seeeing what they had chosen.This taught me how others can have very extreme oppersite opinions.Overall in the lesson i learnt that media can be very powerful aspect of the internet.
