    <td>The lesson started with a discussion of why and when we would need spreadsheets I contributed to the lesson by stating that it any job we more than likely be coming across them and would only warrant the job if we had those certain skills our teacher told us about a fellow colleague who could not use them so our teacher helped him with the basics and he kept working at it until he mastered the basics and then was able to produce a spreadsheet equating all the costs for different cars he was looking to buy and managed to work out the best value car meaning his hard work literally paid off , this inspired me and proved to me why they were such an influence in many people's lives.

The main part of the lesson was discount codes these looked very hard at first but once I managed to get a firm grasp I got a good understanding of what we needed to do I finished most of the work but just needed to find out how to put it all in one cell.</td>
