    <td>This weeks lesson was quite challenging but challenge is good I think everyone has a great feeling after they have succeeded in this lesson we did drop down boxes this allowed us to make our spreadsheets easier to manage as you no longer had to type in the abbreviation of ice cream we wanted to sell.Also the spreadsheet looked nicer and in future I know how to add drop down boxes to my work.
The  Challenge  when we had finished that was to add VAT to our businesses this was a simple equation of the Sub total * 0.2 giving 20 percent of the subtotal and then adding it on to get the grand total.</td>
