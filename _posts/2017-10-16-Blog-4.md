    <td>This lesson was a cover lesson therefore the work set was less challenging and somewhat basic despite that I enjoyed the calmness of the lesson we had to create three extra sheets , costs , discount codes and profit , we were told we needed to think about the extra costs that would be needed to run the business these were things like employee wages and electricity bills and once we started to add all these things up the costs started mounting and I really realised how much it costs to run and set up a business. I found out these costs by searching on the internet the average wage for each job needed and prices of delivery vans which were quite remarkable.</td>
