First in the lesson we discussed the homework from the previous week.The homework was on the things we post today and how they could effect us in our future like getting a job. It can be good However it possibly might be bad. Next we wrote about 15 rules of social media some ones we shoulden't do but ones that can get the full enjoyment out of social media I learnt that rules don’t always have to be negative some can be positive that you / we can follow.Finally we watched a very annoying video called "tweet a little tweet “ the video was about twitter and “how great it is “ and you don’t have to be in the same room as them.

I learnt that i should socilise with people in the community or who i'm with because that can get the full capacity out of a person or conversation.
