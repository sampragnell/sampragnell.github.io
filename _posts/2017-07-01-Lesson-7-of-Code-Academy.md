    <td>I learned by reading the instructions and asking other people for what they thought was the right answer. Also I found double checking my calculations very helpful and allowed me to code faster and more efficently.</td>

    <td>As there was a mix up at// the beginning of the lesson even though they weren't meant to, it hindered  and confused us but in the end I got back into a good flow of work. I think that I need to read the instructions the first time and not just let it go straight out of my brain.</td>
