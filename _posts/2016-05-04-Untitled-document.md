Lesson 11

At the start of the lesson Mr Keen showed us the scene in Harry Potter when they were picked into houses. It happened by putting a hat on called the sorting hat and then it told you which house you were in.

After we watched the video he told us to follow the tutorial on bbc microbit to make the sorting hat on there.i found making the sorting hat fun i was struggling at first but started to figure it out and whizzed through quickly with steps easily being understood the last bit got harder but overall it was a success.

Then Mr Keen told us to go onto a different software on bbc microbit and make a sorting hat on there but for our school houses. There was no tutorial for this one so it was a lot more difficult. When I tried to do it I was struggling with getting the code in the correct place.

Then it was the end of the lesson and Mr Keen told us to finish it off for homework
