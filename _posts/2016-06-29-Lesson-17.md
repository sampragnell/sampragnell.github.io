Lesson 17

At the start of our lesson Mr.Keen told us who hadn't submitted our blog post links which I had, this just furthered my knowledge of How important it is to be up to date.

Next in the lesson for a good 45 mins we carried on developing our games Kishen and i were struggling slightly as we did not know how to create another level without stopping level 1, we tries level 1 = break Level 1 + level = level 2 but none of it worked . however for this week's homework we worked hard being resilient , resolving the issue from this i've learnt to be resilient and resourceful in life situations. 

 

Finally we did a quick survey about race and sporting events just pipping the bell to the finishing line.
