Lesson 14- Microbit

Timetable have now changed for a little while and we now have IT on thursday period 5 so posts will be on thursdays for a bit. Today as well as having the lesson a different day and period we were in IT2 which has the apple mac. They work a little differently but we got the hang of them.

At the start of the lesson we completed a survey that our teacher had put up on google classroom in silence. It was about electronic and social media and how much we use them. They were anonymous though. After that he told us that, in pairs, we were going to plan a game that we would make on microbit. The rest of the lesson we planned our game, we had to answer things like name of game, purpose of game, amount of players, etc. I paired with Kishen.

The Homework from the lesson was to do all tutorials and plan the game.
