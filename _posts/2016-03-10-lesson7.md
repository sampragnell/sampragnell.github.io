Lesson 7

At the start of the lesson we checked the students who had or hadn't done their homework.\Next our teacher talked to us about a boy called Breck Bednar (i had previously seen the documentary) who had been groomed online by a 17 year old called Lewis Danes. After we had a discussion on when to snitch or when it isn’t right to. Our teachers eg was if someone stole a pencil there is no real need to. However if someone told you they were going to kill themselves then you would have to snitch. Next our teacher showed us these set of videos called first to a million. It’s about a brother and a sister both trying to get 1000000 views. After every video there were two options . at the start it was just a bit of fun but then it got out of hand and someone posted a video of someone having sex and then the people who were having sex on camera were geting bullied about it.

From this lesson ilearnt you shouldn't post anything that you wouldn’t want anyone else to post about me
