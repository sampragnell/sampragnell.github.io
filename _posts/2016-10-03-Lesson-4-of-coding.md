    <td>trading positions helped us massively as we could have a fresh mind from doing one job when could use the strategies that we had picked up from doing our previous job to apply on our current job improving us massively as we would predict what was next to try and see if we knew what was coming this helped us learn as we'd pick this up as the new information from each page</td>

    <td>I still need to work on efficiency as this is the key to success my work will flow and the habits will develop like saving my work and not missing out the small details which mean the most (semicolons ) I also need to work on my typyioing as this will help us gain a few pages per lesson</td>

    <td>I will start and through the lesson not get distracted from other groups as at times I can sidetracked and lose concentration this limits my rhythm and I lose the flow meaning my concentration is hard to come by especially as the noise in the room and how everyone is doing different things .
