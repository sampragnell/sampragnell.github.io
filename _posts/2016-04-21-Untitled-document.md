LESSON 9

At the beginning of the lesson Mr Keen talked to us about all the comments and posts on Google Classroom. The comments he did not reply to were the comments which were just stating something such as 'my prezi glitched and now my presentation is gone'. This is just pointless because Mr Keen can not help him with what he wrote.

After we looked at who and who did not hand in there Easter Project about The History of Computers. Some people did not do it or they handed it in incorrectly so they had a 5 minute detention at lunch.

Then we looked at some of the presentations on The History of Computers. We looked at George's, Soham's And Michaelâ€™s. Michels was the best as all the information was clear and detailed. The only thing wrong with Michael's was that as he zoomed out after every slide it makes you feel a bit nasuies and sick.

At the end of the lesson we did a blog assessment on the person next to you. I did Thomas and Thomas did me. For all the question's there were five options. They were it hurts my eyes, could be better, ok, good and awesome. The questions were like how many posts he had done and questions like that. Then we submitted it to Mr Keen. Then it was the end of the lesson.
