Lesson 14

At the start of the lesson we logged on to our computers and went to the front like usual. Mr Keen talked to us about the problems on bbc microbit. He said there are a few errors on microbit that can't be fixed and most of the other errors you can fix. He said the most common error was when you pasted your work back into bbc microbit and the curly braces{ } were not matched up with there other curly brace. This was easy to fix as you just needed to find the correct place to put a curly brace in.

After we carried on with the tutorials on microbit. I was on The Worst Snake Ever. This tutorial really annoyed me as I had spent a lot of time putting all the code in the correct place and making sure it was all right and in the end it just said that there were 'outstanding problems'. When I told Mr Keen he was very annoyed at the machine as nothing was wrong with the code. He told me to move onto the next tutorial. As it was nearly the end of the lesson I did not have time to start the next tutorial.

Mr Keen told us the homework was to do one and a half hours on the tutorials as we did not have a lesson for three weeks. He also said to do the blog which I am doing now!!!
