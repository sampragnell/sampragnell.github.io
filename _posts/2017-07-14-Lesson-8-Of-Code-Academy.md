    <td>There were lots of different pieces of code that I had to utilise so it was quite tough. This was very difficult because you have to put everything you have learnt together and use everything i had previously learnt.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning the most was that I hadn't done any of the coding for a week and had forgotten some of the code. I think that I need to try and remember the code better and search up things that I don't know.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to look more openly towards my code because i need to start thinking like a computer to work to the best of my ability Also I will improve my learning by drilling in to my memory what different code does and how you use it</td>
