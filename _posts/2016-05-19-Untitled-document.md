Lesson 13 12 was last week 

 At the start of the lesson we went and collected some boxes from the financial office. At first I thought our microbits had arrived but there were too many boxes. Our teacher unwrapped one of the boxes and it was a robotic programming 'toy'. However he told us we weren't using them today but if it works well with his year 9 class he may let us have a go next week! After discussing that and a few other questions we got on with last week's work and homework, the tutorials and extensions on javascript. I started on flashpoint today and completed the tutorial, it took quite a long time and it was difficult but i worked with Micheal and we eventually did it. The game was 2-player and it was basically a reaction test to see who spotted the flash first, once they see it they had to click A or B. This week's homework was to, like last week, do a blog post and 20-30 minutes on the tutorials again. For homework I'm going to try and complete the extension to flashpoint where you have to add a score variable in. Thanks for reading this week's blog post! Written on May 13, 2016
