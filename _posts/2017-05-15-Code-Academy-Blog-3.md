  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel I did not make as much progress as I wanted to but I just think that was down to the work getting harder as now it took me longer to process through my ideas in my head and how that would contribute to the code and when I find things harder I want to sidetrack so that was harder but I felt tackling the code was the best option because it doesn't matter if you get it wrong.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to focus fully on the code as sometimes I don't want to do it straight away as it looks hard so I need to make sure I just go for it attack the code at the is the most efficient and best way in my opinion as if you make mistakes you can learn from them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve by being head on with the code also I will read the instructions fully and make sure I understand them as when I progress the code will get harder and harder and if I know the theory it will be easier to code to my full potential.
