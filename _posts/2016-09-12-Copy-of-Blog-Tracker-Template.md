    <td>In the lesson I learnt what a raspberry pie was and how to set it up , adding a mouse and plugging it into to the monitor and computer.
I also learnt how to use the program write code in the actually helped towards my end goal and further.
In the middle of the lesson I saved my work I found this relatively easy as it was in the handbook.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to stop asking other groups and use some initiative to irk out what it telling me to do as it very basic to work out it just needs some thought and effort.
Also what limited my learning was that our Raspberry pie wasn't working because our fuse didn't work therefore we had to go in groups of three this could be a benefit and a negative as. I'm working in a team but I need to start putting in effort realising my mistakes and correcting them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by putting more effort in and asking only when truly necessary 
Next to time I will read the book more precisely not missing out any key steps as these could be crucial to me getting it correct and a better grade.</td>
