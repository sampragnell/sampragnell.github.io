    <td>I feel I got to grasp well with the Code Academy as it was simple and she to understand especially in the form we are doing which is python , I worked strategically through the puzzles that I faced if i found a problem difficult I would use the hint option in the bottom left of the interface this is an extra clue that you could be missing in your code and it is very hseful yet efficient.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I feel I did well in the circumstances and I think the progression of my work was well however at points through my lesson I asked my peers to see if I went wrong where as I should be asking for hints or clue to where I am going wrong as that makes me fully understand the code and makes me feel confident that I can code some more advanced stuff in the future of the term.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will use the hint less as I am not helping myself when I use the feature but I need to remember that everything matters in coding you have to be so pedantic about how look at your code if there is a missing in air for a bracket that is the difference and them margins are the difference between being successful and needed help very 10 minutes</td>
